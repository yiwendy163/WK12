    "### Make It Harder\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural network models can seem simple to explain in a general sense: they're long and wide computation graphs made up of simple operations that have been tuned to achieve a specific task. Once they're training, or trained, their details and specificities are a little less easy to describe. It's hard to know exactly what each neuron is doing, and what part of the computation they are responsible for. We can train the same network, with the same parameters, using the same input data, and end up with wildly different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is one reason why it's hard to debug a network when it doesn't seem to be learning properly, or when it starts to overfit and memorize the training data. Which neurons do we tune ?\n",
    "\n",
    "One common situation that can lead to overfitting is when a network ends up with parameters that make it perform well on the training data without really activating all of its neurons. This is usually what is happening if adding layers to a network doesn't improve its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "One set of strategies for improving neural network training in these cases involves making the training process harder than it has to be. It's like we're challenging the neural network to learn more than it has, so that later it has an easier time with the regular data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple technique to achieve this is to add `Dropout` layers to our network. A `Dropout` layer is a layer of neurons that don't perform any mathematical operation, but are selectively dropped out of the network randomly during training. This has the effect of randomly changing the network's architecture during training and preventing the network from becoming too reliant on specific neurons. Instead, it encourages the network to learn more robust features by activating more diverse sets of neurons.\n",

    "#### Activation Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Another technique that is used to keep our neural networks from memorizing data has to do with the range of the values that get passed between its inner layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input data coming into the network is most likely normalized, but after the first layer, the network weights might really change the distribution of the data as it flows through the network. Moreover, individual batches with different input value distributions can bias the network towards certain goals.\n",

    "#### Batch Normalization\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to handle these situations is to normalize the data as it passes through the network. Batch Normalization is the process of normalizing the activations of our network by using the mean and standard deviation of an activation neuron across a batch. The result is that the activations between batches become more similar. Batch normalization is dependent on batch size, so it's not effective for small batches.\n",

    "\n",
    "Layer Normalization scales activations using the mean and standard deviation of all activations across a layer. It's effective for sequence models like RNNs and Transformers, and for scenarios with small batch sizes, and doesn't require a large batch to get a good estimate for mean and standard deviation. \n",
